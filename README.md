# Pacific Creole Tools

This project, a set of NLP related tools for the Pacific Creoles. 

The tools:
- POS Tagger
- Lemmatiser
- (Universal) Depdency Parser

## Languages:
- Tok Pisin (Papua New Guinea)
- Pijin (Solomon Islands)
- Bislama (Vanuatu)z


## Overview:

The current version, as of 02-06-2023, uses a rule-based approach that uses a generalised dictionary. This will be improved with specialised dictionaries and rules. 

The rule based approach will be contrasted and compared with ML approaches.

One benefit of rule-based approaches is to speed up the annotation process for the development of training data for ML approaches.
